## What this repo is

Ian Xiaohei Illustrations is a Codex Skill that guides an AI Agent to generate in-article illustrations for articles, posts, blogs, Notion docs, and methodology content (originally built for Chinese content).

It is not a generic illustration prompt, and it is not a PPT infographic template. Its core goal: first understand the cognitive anchors in the article, then turn one judgment, flow, structure, state, or metaphor into a memorable 16:9 hand-drawn explainer image.

The default visual IP is Xiaohei (小黑, "Little Black"): a small character with a solid black body, white dot eyes, thin legs, and a blank expression. Xiaohei is not a mascot, not a sticker, and not a decoration standing in the corner — Xiaohei is an absurd worker earnestly keeping the system running.

In one sentence: **don't let the AI just "add a picture" — make it draw one key cognitive move from the article.**

---

## Who it's for

Especially good for:

- People who write articles and need in-article illustrations and article illustrations
- People making knowledge content, methodology content, or AI workflow content
- People who want to turn abstract judgments into concrete metaphors
- People who want an illustration style that's lighter, weirder, and more personally recognizable than PPT infographics
- People producing content with Codex who want one visual language they can reuse reliably

Not for:

- People who want commercial illustration, brand KVs, or polished flat illustration
- People who want traditional PPT infographics, complex architecture diagrams, or flowcharts
- People who want kids' cartoons, cute IPs, or sticker-pack styles
- People who want to cram long body text, extended explanations, or full course pages into one image
- People who need strictly editable vector source files

---

## What it produces

Default output:

- 16:9 landscape in-article illustrations
- A shot list of 4-8 images per article
- For each image: theme, core meaning, structure type, Xiaohei's action, and suggested labels
- Final PNG images, saved to `assets/<article-slug>-illustrations/` in the workspace

Not output by default:

- PPTX / PDF / Keynote
- SVG / HTML / Canvas editable graphics
- Commercial posters or cover KVs
- Text-heavy infographics

---

## Visual style

By default this skill uses Ian's "absurd Xiaohei in-article illustration" style:

- Pure white background — no paper texture, beige, shadows, or gradients
- Black hand-drawn line art, thin lines, slightly wobbly
- Plenty of white space — the subject fills only about 40%-60% of the frame
- Sparse red, orange, and blue handwritten annotations (in the article's language)
- One image expresses one core action, structure, state, or metaphor
- Xiaohei must take part in the core action, never just decorate
- Absurd, creative, clean — but never childish, never acting cute

These images are style-calibration samples, not composition templates. When you use the skill, reinvent the metaphor from the current article — don't copy the objects and compositions of old examples.

## Install

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/helloianneo/ian-xiaohei-illustrations.git
cd ian-xiaohei-illustrations
```

Copy the skill into your Codex skills directory:

```bash
mkdir -p "${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/skills"
cp -R ./ian-xiaohei-illustrations "${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/skills/"
```

After installing, use it in Codex:

```text
Use $ian-xiaohei-illustrations to design and generate 5 absurd Xiaohei in-article illustrations for this article.
```

---

## How to use

### Plan illustrations only

```text
Use $ian-xiaohei-illustrations but don't generate images yet.
Analyze the article below for spots worth illustrating, and output a shot list of about 5 images.
For each image, spell out: which paragraph it goes after, theme, core meaning, structure type, what Xiaohei is doing, and suggested labels.

<paste article>
```

### Generate in-article illustrations directly

```text
Use $ian-xiaohei-illustrations to generate 4 absurd Xiaohei in-article illustrations for the article below.
Requirements: 16:9 landscape, pure white background, black hand-drawn line art, sparse red/orange/blue handwritten annotations.

<paste article>
```

### Generate one image for a single concept

```text
Use $ian-xiaohei-illustrations to generate one in-article illustration for "trust isn't shouted into existence — it's laid down one piece of evidence at a time".
Make it absurd but clean, and Xiaohei must carry the core action.
```

### Remove a title or wrong text from an image

```text
Use $ian-xiaohei-illustrations to edit this image: remove the "Flowchart" title in the top-left corner and keep everything else unchanged.
```

## Workflow

The skill's flow:

1. Read the article, Markdown, Notion content, screenshots, or a topic the user gives
2. Distill core ideas, cognitive turning points, process structures, and passages that fit visualization
3. Output a shot list first: one cognitive anchor per image
4. Pick a structure type for each image: Workflow, System close-up, Before-after contrast, Character states, Concept metaphor, Method layers, Map route, or Mini comic panels
5. Reinvent a low-tech, absurd but coherent physical metaphor
6. Give Xiaohei the core action
7. Generate each image with its own image-model call
8. Check against the QA checklist: white background, white space, Xiaohei's action, annotations, no PPT feel, no old-example clones
9. Save the final PNGs and report each image's purpose and path

## Notes

- The shorter the in-image text, the more stable the result.
- One core structure per image — don't turn the article into an instruction manual.
- Xiaohei must carry the core action; if the image still fully works with Xiaohei removed, Xiaohei is too decorative.
- Example images are only for calibrating line density, white space, color restraint, and how Xiaohei participates — don't clone their compositions.
- AI image models can produce typos, hallucinated labels, style drift, or stray titles — check every generation.
- If typos are severe, cut down the labels first and regenerate.
